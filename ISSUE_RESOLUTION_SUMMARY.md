## 🔴 Issue #1: Pydantic Version Mismatch (CRITICAL - FIXED)

### Discovery

While validating smoke tests locally, the backend failed to start with:

```python
ImportError: cannot import name 'field_validator' from 'pydantic'
Did you mean: 'root_validator'?
```

### Root Cause

| Component | Expected | Found | Problem |
|-----------|----------|-------|---------|
| **Code** | Pydantic v2 syntax | `field_validator` | ✅ Correct |
| **Environment** | Pydantic v2 | Version **1.10.24** | ❌ Wrong |
| **requirements.txt** | Should specify v2 | Not specified | ❌ Missing |

**Why it happened**:
- Code uses Pydantic v2 syntax (`field_validator` at `src/common/config.py:7`)
- FastAPI 0.115.11 requires `pydantic` but doesn't pin version
- pip installed Pydantic v1.10.24 for compatibility
- Version mismatch → import error

### ✅ Resolution

**1. Updated `requirements.txt`**:
```diff
  altair==5.4.1
  annotated-types==0.7.0
+ pydantic>=2.9.0
  anyio==4.6.2.post1
```

**2. Created documentation**:
- `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` - Complete issue tracking
- `PYDANTIC_FIX.md` - Quick fix guide

**3. Updated validation docs**:
- `VALIDATION_RESULTS.md` - Noted issue and resolution

### Quick Fix for Users

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'pydantic>=2.9.0'
```

### Impact

- 🔴 **Critical**: Blocks backend startup
- ✅ **Fixed**: requirements.txt now prevents this
- 📝 **Documented**: Multiple guides for users

## 🟡 Issue #2: Make Help "Broken Pipe" (COSMETIC - NOT A BUG)

### Discovery

When running `make help | head -30`, saw:

```
make: *** [help] Broken pipe: 13
```

### Root Cause

This is **normal Unix behavior**, not a bug:

1. `make help` outputs 40+ lines
2. `head -30` reads 30 lines then closes pipe
3. `make` tries to write remaining lines to closed pipe
4. OS sends SIGPIPE signal
5. Make reports "Broken pipe"

### ✅ Resolution

**Status**: No fix needed - working as designed

**Evidence**:
```bash
$ make help  # Without piping
Exit code: 0  ✅

$ make version
Exit code: 0  ✅

$ make test-unit
Exit code: 0  ✅
```

All make commands work perfectly.

### Impact

- 🟢 **Cosmetic only**: Appears when piping to `head`
- ✅ **Not a bug**: Standard Unix behavior
- ✅ **No fix needed**: All commands work correctly
